# About the Marine CDR Efficiency Tools

These Marine CDR tools are a joint project between CarbonPlan and [[C]Worthy](https://www.cworthy.org/) to help people understand how marine CDR works.

Both tools allow users to explore how a marine CDR intervention taking place in a certain region and season leads to carbon removal over time. The first focuses on ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) — an approach that adds alkalinity to the surface ocean, increasing its ability to absorb CO₂ without acidifying. The second focuses on direct ocean removal (DOR) — an approach that extracts CO₂ from seawater, storing it, and creating space for the ocean to re-absorb CO₂ to return to its original state.

Both map tools are based on the same modeling framework, using a coarse-resolution global ocean circulation model from the [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/). Briefly, we divided the surface ocean into 690 regions, and simulating an OAE or DOR intervention occurring in that region for 1 month (e.g. adding alkalinity or removing dissolved inorganic carbon at a rate of at a rate of 10 mol m<sup>–2</sup>yr<sup>–1</sup>). We then ran the model for 15 years to simulate how this intervention led to atmospheric carbon removal.

You can use the tools to explore global patterns in carbon removal efficiency, or drill down to visualize how these interventions move through the ocean and result in carbon removal over time.

## Map variables

The two mapping tools share many of the same variables.

## Comparing OAE and DOR

We initially defined OAE efficiency as the amount of CO₂ removed per unit of alkalinity added. But to compare across DOR and OAE, we had to translate that concept into a common efficiency metric: the amount of CO₂ absorbed from the atmosphere per unit of removal potential generated by the intervention. For DOR, the maximum potential removal is equivalent to the amount of CO₂ extracted from the surface ocean. But for OAE, this comparison requires calculating the maximum removal potential associated with the simulated alkalinity additions.
