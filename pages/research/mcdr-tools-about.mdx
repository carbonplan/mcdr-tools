# About the Marine CDR Tools

These Marine CDR tools are a joint project between CarbonPlan and [[C]Worthy](https://www.cworthy.org/) designed to help people understand how marine CDR works.

Both tools allow users to explore how differences in location and season affect how much carbon removal a marine CDR intervention can achieve over time. The first focuses on ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) ‚Äî an approach that adds alkalinity to the surface ocean, increasing its ability to absorb CO‚ÇÇ by improving chemical buffering capacity. The second focuses on direct ocean removal (DOR) ‚Äî an approach that extracts CO‚ÇÇ from seawater, creating space for the ocean to re-absorb atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ to return to its original state, and storing or otherwise utilizing the extracted CO‚ÇÇ.

Both map tools are based on the same modeling framework, using a coarse-resolution global ocean circulation model from the [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/). Briefly, we divided the surface ocean into 690 regions, and simulated an OAE or DOR intervention occurring in that region for 1 month (e.g., adding alkalinity or removing dissolved inorganic carbon at a rate of 10 mol m<sup>‚Äì2</sup>yr<sup>‚Äì1</sup>). We then ran the model for 15 years to simulate how this intervention led to atmospheric carbon removal.

You can use the tools to explore global patterns in carbon removal efficiency, or drill down to visualize how these interventions move through the ocean and result in carbon removal over time.

## Map variables

The two mapping tools share many of the same variables.

## Comparing OAE and DOR

We initially defined OAE efficiency (ùúÇ) as the amount of CO‚ÇÇ removed from the atmosphere per unit of alkalinity added. However, to compare across DOR and OAE, we use a different efficiency metric (Œ≥): the amount of CO‚ÇÇ absorbed from the atmosphere per unit of removal potential generated by the intervention.

For DOR, the maximum potential removal is equivalent to the amount of CO‚ÇÇ extracted from the surface ocean. For OAE, this comparison requires calculating the maximum removal potential associated with the simulated alkalinity additions. This is done as follows. Our original definition of efficiency, the amount of CO‚ÇÇ removed from the atmosphere per unit of alkalinity added, can be written as

> ùúÇ(t) = ‚àÜDIC(t) / ‚àÜAlk

where ‚àÜAlk is the amount of alkalinity added to the ocean and ‚àÜDIC(t) is the resulting
change in the ocean carbon inventory over time. Under the condition of full re-equilibration,
we have

> ùúÇmax = ‚àÜDIC(t=‚àû) / ‚àÜAlk

where ‚àÜDIC(t=‚àû) is the amount of potential DIC uptake induced by the chemical effects of the alkalinity addition. Therefore, to compute an efficiency metric for OAE that is directly comparable to DOR, we divide ùúÇ(t) by ùúÇmax, yielding

> Œ≥OAE(t) = ùúÇ(t) / ùúÇmax

To perform this conversion on the OAE dataset, we estimate ùúÇ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì from the background ocean state, using the thermodynamic equations defining the seawater carbonate system equilibrium chemistry. Notably, ùúÇ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì varies from about 0.7 in the tropical surface ocean to about 0.9 at high latitudes. This approach is not perfect, as we are using time-averaged fields and mixing along the trajectory of the alkalinity plume entrains waters with distinct chemical composition. In practice, however, we find that the errors introduced by these factors are very small (less than ¬±0.1) relative to the large-scale spatial and seasonal structure in the efficiency fields, so the approach provides a robust basis to compare the efficiency of OAE and DOR.
